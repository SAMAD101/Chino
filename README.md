## üêç Python Version Support

This project is designed to be compatible with specific versions of Python for optimal performance and stability.

### Supported Python Version

- **Python 3.11.7**

> ‚ùóÔ∏è For the best experience and performance, it is recommended to use the version mentioned above.

Before diving into the project, ensure that you have the correct Python version installed. To check the version of Python you currently have, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

### üêç Installing Python 3.11.7 with `pyenv`

**Protip:** Managing multiple Python versions is a breeze with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). It allows you to seamlessly switch between different Python versions without the need to reinstall them.

If you haven't installed `pyenv` yet, follow their [official guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to set it up.

Once you have `pyenv` ready, install the recommended Python version by running:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.7
```

> When you navigate to this project's directory in the future, `pyenv` will automatically select the recommended Python version, thanks to the `.python-version` file in the project root.

```

## Usage üìñ

Commands and options are available by running:

```bash
chino --help
```
For using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) features, follow these steps:

1. You will need to put your documents in the `~/.local/share/chino/data` directory. If not there, make one.

2. Also,make sure you have a directory: `~/.local/share/chino/chroma`. This directory will contain the OpenAI embeddings (embedding vectors) for the documents.

3. Process the documents and create the embeddings using the following command:
    ```bash
    chino migrate
    ```

> The directory data and chroma directories will be made more configurable in the future releases.

### Using Query mode:

Once your documents are processed. You can use the query mode to give prompts for the documents [RAG].
Start Chino by running:
```bash
chino start
```
and use `\q:` before your prompt to use it in query mode.
